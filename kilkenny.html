        <div class="mainImgl"><img src="images/11glenGroup.jpg" alt="Four people in front of lake and mountains" width="200"><p>Glendalough is a glacial valley in County Wicklow, Ireland, famous for its Early Medieval monastic settlement founded in the 6th century by St Kevin. Kevin, a descendant of Leinster royalty, studied under three holy men before returning to Glendalough to establish a monastery at the confluence of two rivers. His writings, often misinterpreted as referring to literal battles, likely describe his inner struggles and temptations. Kevin's holiness drew numerous followers, and he died around 618. For six centuries, the monastery thrived, with historical records noting the deaths of abbots and frequent raids.</p>
        <p>In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Glendalough Valley was home to a lead mine. However, Glendalough is now primarily a recreational area, popular for picnics, walking along trails of varying difficulty, and rock climbing.</p>
        <p>In the early 12th century, Glendalough was designated as one of the two dioceses of North Leinster at the Synod of Rath Breasail. St. Laurence O'Toole, who became Abbot of Glendalough and later Archbishop of Dublin, is another notable figure associated with the area. Despite its destruction by English forces in 1398, Glendalough remained a place of local importance and pilgrimage.</p>
        <p>My visit to Glendalough was simply gorgeous. Exploring the remnants of the town was fascinating, each building exuding its own unique charm. The wealth of history was captivating, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning about it. Perhaps the highlight of my visit was the hike to the upper lake. I ventured off the main trail to climb around the mountain footpath above, thoroughly enjoying the challenge and the chance to explore nature. The hike felt like a joyful frolic in the forest, and the views at the end were breathtaking. I wished I could swim in the lake, but there was more to see, making it a day of continuous discovery and delight.</p></div>

            <div class="mainImgr"><img src="images/11kilkRoomY.jpg" alt="Yellow room with ornate decor" width="200"><p>Kilkenny (Irish: Cill Chainnigh, meaning 'church of Cainnech') is a city in County Kilkenny, Ireland, situated in the South-East Region and the province of Leinster. The city straddles both banks of the River Nore and had a population of 27,184 according to the 2022 census, making it the thirteenth-largest urban center in Ireland.</p>
            <p>Kilkenny is renowned as a tourist destination, boasting a wealth of historic buildings such as Kilkenny Castle, St Canice's Cathedral and round tower, Rothe House, Shee Alms House, Black Abbey, St. Mary's Cathedral, The Tholsel, St. Francis Abbey, Grace's Castle, and St. John's Priory. The city is also famous for its craft and design workshops, the Watergate Theatre, public gardens, and museums. Kilkenny hosts numerous annual events, including the Kilkenny Arts Festival, the Cat Laughs comedy festival, and the Kilkenny Roots Festival.</p>
            <p>The city&apos;s origins trace back to an early 6th-century ecclesiastical foundation within the Kingdom of Ossory. Following the 12th-century Norman invasion of Ireland, Kilkenny Castle and a series of defensive walls were constructed to protect the emerging Norman merchant town. In 1207, William Marshall, Lord of Leinster, granted Kilkenny its first charter as a town. By the late 13th century, the town was under Hiberno-Norman control, and the Statutes of Kilkenny were enacted there in 1367 to address the decline of the Hiberno-Norman Lordship of Ireland. Kilkenny received a Royal Charter from King James I in 1609, elevating it to city status. The city played a pivotal role during the Irish Rebellion of 1641, serving as the base for the Irish Catholic Confederation until the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649. Although Kilkenny has not been administered as a city since 1840, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 allows for its continued description as a city.</p>
            <p>Historically, Kilkenny has been a brewing center since the late 17th century and still hosts several breweries. The Heritage Council is headquartered at Church Lane in the former Bishop's Palace. The Roman Catholic Bishop of Ossory's seat is at St Mary's Cathedral, while the Church of Ireland Bishop of Cashel and Ossory's seat is at St Canice's Cathedral.</p>   
            <p>My visit to Kilkenny was fantastic. The town was charming, with plenty of shopping opportunities. Our visit to Kilkenny Castle was particularly memorable, even though a bird decided to poop on me just before we went in! The castle itself was fabulous, with its impressive decor and scale, and an abundance of historical information to absorb. I especially enjoyed examining the small details, like the intricate wallpaper and tapestries.</p></div>
