This trip was simply magical. Glendalough was simply gorgeous. Exploring the remnants of the town was quite interesting, not to mention beautiful. Each building had its own charm, and the day was fantastic to explore. There was so much history to unpack, and I loved to learn it. Perhaps my favorite part though was the hike to the upper lake. I went off the trail to climb around the mountain footpath above, and I had a great time exploring the nature on the hike. It was challenging and fun, and I felt like a little child frolicking in the forest. The views at the end were simply to die for, and all I wanted to do was to swim. But alas, we had more to see.</p></div>

The town was quite cute and there was quite a bit of shopping to do. We went to visit the <a href="https://kilkennycastle.ie">Kilkenny Castle</a>(after a bird pooped on me) and it was fabulous. The decor and scale of the place was fantastic, and there was lots of historical information to unpack as well. My favorite part was to look at the small details like the wallpaper and the intricacies of the tapestries. Overall, it was a fantastic day. We all were pretty pooped by the end and the bus was silent with sleeping students.</p></div>
