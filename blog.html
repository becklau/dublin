            <h3>Visiting Vice Coffee</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-08">May 10, 2024</time>
            <p>After Class on Wednesday I went with Anastacia and Navya to a great hardware store and lunch, but after, I peeled off to visit a coffee shop I researched before coming. When I arrived, it was not what I was expecting! By day, it is a regular cafe, but by night it also becomes a cocktail bar. The decor was adorable, and it is a very queer place. The coffee was spectacular (I got an americano with beans roasted in the UK) and I was able to get a few emails written regarding my summer jobs. After that, I went back to StayCity to do some laundry and later got dinner with some of the class.</p>

            <h3>Exploring Dublin: A City of History and Culture</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-07">May 7, 2024</time>
            <p>On Tuesday, we traveled around the city. This was extremely informative although quite bloody. It was quite interesting to hear about the long history of the state, as it is a stark difference of the few hundred years of the colonized US. We visited many different areas like the National History Museum, Dublin Castle, and Phoenix Park. Each place had its own unique history and culture, and it is clear to see how important these places are to Irish culture. We learned about the resilience of the Irish population and the great diaspora of the Irish people due to fleeing from the country. </p>
