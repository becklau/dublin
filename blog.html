            <h3>Exploring Dublin: A City of History and Culture</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-07">May 7, 2024</time>
            <p>On Tuesday, we traveled around the city on a bus tour. This was extremely informative although quite bloody. It was quite interesting to hear about the long history of the state, as it is a stark difference of the few hundred years of the colonized US. We visited many different areas like the <a href="https://www.museum.ie/en-IE/Museums/Natural-History">National History Museum</a>, <a href="https://www.dublincastle.ie">Dublin Castle</a>, and <a href="https://www.phoenixpark.ie">Phoenix Park</a>. Each place had its own unique history and culture, and it is clear to see how important these places are to Irish culture. We learned about the resilience of the Irish population and the great diaspora of the Irish people due to fleeing from the country. <br><br>
            Arriving back to the apartment after the tour, I was pretty beat. I ended up going to the local grocery store to grab a few things for dinner, and I ended up making myself a nice meal. The kitchen is quite small, but I was able to manage. Later that night, I met up with a few classmates and we went to <a href="https://darkeykellys.ie">Darkey Kelley&apos;s</a>. A family friend told me about the place, so I was excited to visit. They had some great live music going and everyone there was quite sweet. We stayed for some tunes and then head out for home. <br><br>

            <h3>Visiting Vice Coffee</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-08">May 8, 2024</time>
            <p>After Class on Wednesday I went with Anastacia and Navya to a great hardware store and lunch. We needed charging adapters as our UK ones did not work. We also went to <a href="https://www.xianstreetfooddublin.ie">Xian Street Food</a> and finally got a spice bowl. Apparently it is an Irish Chinese creation, and it was quite delicious. I mean, you cannot go wrong with a bowl of spiced fried food. After lunch, I peeled off to visit a coffee shop I researched before coming, <a href="https://www.vicecoffeeinc.com">Vice Coffee</a>. When I arrived, it was not what I was expecting! By day, it is a regular cafe, but by night it also becomes a cocktail bar. The decor was adorable, and it is a very queer place. The coffee was spectacular (I got an americano with beans roasted in the UK) and I was able to get a few emails written regarding my summer jobs. <br><br>

            After my adventures, I went back to StayCity to do some laundry and later got dinner with some of the class. I was planning on meeting some other classmates at St. Stephen&apos;s Green, but they were leaving just as I had arrived. We were able to make plans for dinner though. We went to <a href="https://johnsbar.ie"> John&apos;s Bar and Haberdashery</a> to get a student meal deal, and the burgers were absolutely delicious! There was a great atmosphere and we all had a blast. We all then went out to <a href="https://www.jackies.ie">Jackie&apos;s</a>, a funky cocktail bar. We all got to know each other a bit more, and got home early enough to have a good rest before class. <br><br>

            <h3>Lectures, Food, and Fun!</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-09">May 9, 2024</time>
            <p>On the way to class in the morning, I walked alone and listened to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3440hCSfwYXxJcbQ0j3jAJ">&apos;The Age of Pleasure&apos; by Janelle Monet</a>. I have been trying to find the best albums that give the right “vibe” for being in Dublin, and that one was quite great. It is upbeat matching the nice day funky enough to match the culture. I am really enjoying class, and am excited to keep building this site, as I am rather proud of how it has been turning out. We all walked back to the apartment and I stopped by the <a href="https://thefumbally.ie">Fumbally</a> for a piece of Focaccia bread to make a sandwich at home. We all took some time to ourselves and got ready for our guest lecture.<br><br>

            The guest lecture was extremely interesting! We learned about Gamification and its implementation into technology. It made me interested in the idea of working within gaming, as UX is such a powerful tool that can be used anywhere. After the lecture, most of the class went off to explore. We searched for a dinner spot, and ended up going to a place called <a href="https://theramenbar.ie">The Ramen Bar</a>. It was extremely tasty, and we had the whole basement to ourselves! That night, I spent some time with Navya and my roomie Annabel. We went to Street 66, which was so bright and welcoming. Definitely a place to visit again before we leave.<br><br>

            <h3>An EPIC day!</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-10">May 10, 2024</time>
            <p>After class on Friday, We all walked home together had a few hours to do our own thing. I made some lunch and got work done, and after we all traveled to the <a href=“https://epicchq.com/“>EPIC museum</a>. It was quite an interesting place, and there was a lot of great information. What was most interesting to me was the section on music and dance, where we learned lots about how many of the most famous current artists are of Irish decent. There were a lot of interactive exhibits, which made the experience all the more fun. <br><br>

            Afterwards, Navya and I went to get a treat and coffee. It was a gorgeous day so we went to <a href="https://www.vicecoffeeinc.com">Vice Coffee</a> again where we had delicious treats and great coffee for a midday pick me up. We then went to <a href=“https://www.dublincity.ie/residential/parks”>St. Patrick&apos;s Park</a>. We got some work done while basking in the sun. Later that night we explored the Temple Bar Area and Drury St. We all had a great time hanging out and soon head back for a good night&apos;s rest before our big day trip tomorrow.

            <h3>Glendalough and Kilkenny!</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-11">May 11, 2024</time>
            <p>On Saturday, We made a great trip to <a href="https://glendalough.ie">Glendalough</a> and <a href="https://visitkilkenny.ie">Kilkenny</a>. This trip was simply magical. Glendalough was simply gorgeous. Exploring the remnants of the town was quite interesting, not to mention beautiful. Each building had its own charm, and the day was fantastic to explore. There was so much history to unpack, and I loved to learn it. Perhaps my favorite part though was the hike to the upper lake. I went off the trail to climb around the mountain footpath above, and I had a great time exploring the nature on the hike. It was challenging and fun, and I felt like a little child frolicking in the forest. The views at the end were simply to die for, and all I wanted to do was to swim. But alas, we had more to see. <br><br>

            Kilkenny was also fantastic. The town was quite cute and there was quite a bit of shopping to do. We went to visit the <a href="https://kilkennycastle.ie">Kilkenny Castle</a> (after a bird pooped on me) and it was fabulous. The decor and scale of the place was fantastic, and there was lots of historical information to unpack as well. My favorite part was to look at the small details like the wallpaper and the intricacies of the tapestries. Overall, it was a fantastic day. We all were pretty pooped by the end and the bus was silent with sleeping students.<br><br>

            <h3>Learning all about Northern Ireland</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-12">May 12, 2024</time>
            <p>Sunday was a free day, so a few of us decided to make the most of it. We did a <a href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Dublin/Northern-Ireland-Day-Trip-from-Dublin-Belfast-Black-Taxi-Tour-and-Giants-Causeway/d503-5300BLACKCAB">Guided Tour</a> that took us from Dublin to Belfast, <a href="https://discovernorthernireland.com/things-to-do/dunluce-castle-p675011">Dunce Castle</a>, and to the <a href="https://giantscausewayofficialguide.com">Giants Causeway</a>. This tour was spectacular. First we did the Black Cab Tour which was perhaps the most informative thing I have done thus far. We learned of the politics of Northern Ireland, which are not made for the people. There are the Irish Nationalists, those who wish for a united Ireland, and the Unionists, those who support the UK rule within Ireland. These groups of people ate segregated by a wall, and the murals that exist on each side are opposites. On the Irish side, there are murals of the hunger strike, Nelson Mandela and civil rights activists, and support for Palestine. Crossing the wall, there is harsh propaganda messaging and extreme support for Israel. It was extremely difficult to see this difference, and it puts into perspective how severe this issue is. One thing that our tour guide said that really stuck with me was this: “The UK would have bombed us by now, but they can&apos;t because we share the same skin color.” These politics will be something that I continue to watch and support until there is a whole Ireland. <br><br>
            After the tour, we went to the Dunluce Castle. This was beautiful. It was a perfect day to visit, and the scenery was sublime. There were many places to explore and the ruins were intricate and interesting. After our tour here, we went off to the Giant&apos;s Causeway, which may be one of the coolest things I have ever seen. We took a cliff walk hike down to the shore and the views were simply spectacular. We learned all about the geological history as well as the mythological, both giving great reasoning to this unique formation. Each rock is a polygon, and it was like a set os stepping stones throughout. There were waves crashing on the shore, and little pools of water with lower sets of rocks. It is truly something I think everyone should see, and I could not recommend it more. We took a bus home and I got some good rest for the remainder of the night.<br><br>
