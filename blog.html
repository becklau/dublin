            <h3>Exploring Dublin: A City of History and Culture</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-07">May 7, 2024</time>
            <p>On Tuesday, we traveled around the city on a bus tour. This was extremely informative although quite bloody. It was quite interesting to hear about the long history of the state, as it is a stark difference of the few hundred years of the colonized US. We visited many different areas like the <a href="https://www.museum.ie/en-IE/Museums/Natural-History">National History Museum</a>, <a href="https://www.dublincastle.ie">Dublin Castle</a>, and <a href="https://www.phoenixpark.ie">Phoenix Park</a>. Each place had its own unique history and culture, and it is clear to see how important these places are to Irish culture. We learned about the resilience of the Irish population and the great diaspora of the Irish people due to fleeing from the country. </p>
            <p>Arriving back to the apartment after the tour, I was pretty beat. I ended up going to the local grocery store to grab a few things for dinner, and I ended up making myself a nice meal. The kitchen is quite small, but I was able to manage. Later that night, I met up with a few classmates and we went to <a href="https://darkeykellys.ie">Darkey Kelley&apos;s</a>. A family friend told me about the place, so I was excited to visit. They had some great live music going and everyone there was quite sweet. We stayed for some tunes and then head out for home.</p>

            <h3>Visiting Vice Coffee</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-08">May 8, 2024</time>
            <p>After Class on Wednesday I went with Anastacia and Navya to a great hardware store and lunch. We needed charging adapters as our UK ones did not work. We also went to <a href="https://www.xianstreetfooddublin.ie">Xian Street Food</a> and finally got a spice bowl. Apparently it is an Irish Chinese creation, and it was quite delicious. I mean, you cannot go wrong with a bowl of spiced fried food. After lunch, I peeled off to visit a coffee shop I researched before coming, <a href="https://www.vicecoffeeinc.com">Vice Coffee</a>. When I arrived, it was not what I was expecting! By day, it is a regular cafe, but by night it also becomes a cocktail bar. The decor was adorable, and it is a very queer place. The coffee was spectacular (I got an americano with beans roasted in the UK) and I was able to get a few emails written regarding my summer jobs. </p>
            <p>After my adventures, I went back to StayCity to do some laundry and later got dinner with some of the class. I was planning on meeting some other classmates at <span aria-label="saint">St.</span> Stephen&apos;s Green, but they were leaving just as I had arrived. We were able to make plans for dinner though. We went to <a href="https://johnsbar.ie"> John&apos;s Bar and Haberdashery</a> to get a student meal deal, and the burgers were absolutely delicious! There was a great atmosphere and we all had a blast. We all then went out to <a href="https://www.jackies.ie">Jackie&apos;s</a>, a funky cocktail bar. We all got to know each other a bit more, and got home early enough to have a good rest before class. </p>

            <h3>Lectures, Food, and Fun!</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-09">May 9, 2024</time>
            <p>On the way to class in the morning, I walked alone and listened to Sound and Color by Alabama Shakes. I have been trying to find the best albums that give the right “vibe” for being in Dublin, and that one was quite great. It is upbeat matching the nice day funky enough to match the culture. I am really enjoying class, and am excited to keep building this site, as I am rather proud of how it has been turning out. We all walked back to the apartment and I stopped by the <a href="https://thefumbally.ie">Fumbally</a> for a piece of Focaccia bread to make a sandwich at home. We all took some time to ourselves and got ready for our guest lecture. </p>
            <p>The guest lecture was extremely interesting! We learned about Gamification and its implementation into technology. It made me interested in the idea of working within gaming, as UX is such a powerful tool that can be used anywhere. After the lecture, most of the class went off to explore. We searched for a dinner spot, and ended up going to a place called <a href="https://theramenbar.ie">The Ramen Bar</a>. It was extremely tasty, and we had the whole basement to ourselves! That night, I spent some time with Navya and my roomie Annabel. We went to Street 66, which was so bright and welcoming. Definitely a place to visit again before we leave.</p>

            <h3>An EPIC day!</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-10">May 10, 2024</time>
            <p>After class on Friday, We all walked home together had a few hours to do our own thing. I made some lunch and got work done, and after we all traveled to the <a href=“https://epicchq.com/“>EPIC museum</a>. It was quite an interesting place, and there was a lot of great information. What was most interesting to me was the section on music and dance, where we learned lots about how many of the most famous current artists are of Irish decent. There were a lot of interactive exhibits, which made the experience all the more fun. </p>
            <p>Afterwards, Navya and I went to get a treat and coffee. It was a gorgeous day so we went to <a href="https://www.vicecoffeeinc.com">Vice Coffee</a> again where we had delicious treats and great coffee for a midday pick me up. We then went to <a href=“https://www.dublincity.ie/residential/parks”><span aria-label="saint">St.</span> Patrick&apos;s Park</a>. We got some work done while basking in the sun. Later that night we explored the Temple Bar Area and Drury St. We all had a great time hanging out and soon head back for a good night&apos;s rest before our big day trip tomorrow.</p>

            <h3>Glendalough and Kilkenny!</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-11">May 11, 2024</time>
            <p>On Saturday, We made a great trip to <a href="https://glendalough.ie">Glendalough</a> and <a href="https://visitkilkenny.ie">Kilkenny</a>. This trip was simply magical. Glendalough was simply gorgeous. Exploring the remnants of the town was quite interesting, not to mention beautiful. Each building had its own charm, and the day was fantastic to explore. There was so much history to unpack, and I loved to learn it. Perhaps my favorite part though was the hike to the upper lake. I went off the trail to climb around the mountain footpath above, and I had a great time exploring the nature on the hike. It was challenging and fun, and I felt like a little child frolicking in the forest. The views at the end were simply to die for, and all I wanted to do was to swim. But alas, we had more to see. </p>
            <p>Kilkenny was also fantastic. The town was quite cute and there was quite a bit of shopping to do. We went to visit the <a href="https://kilkennycastle.ie">Kilkenny Castle</a> (after a bird pooped on me) and it was fabulous. The decor and scale of the place was fantastic, and there was lots of historical information to unpack as well. My favorite part was to look at the small details like the wallpaper and the intricacies of the tapestries. Overall, it was a fantastic day. We all were pretty pooped by the end and the bus was silent with sleeping students.</p>

            <h3>Learning all about Northern Ireland</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-12">May 12, 2024</time>
            <p>Sunday was a free day, so a few of us decided to make the most of it. We did a <a href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Dublin/Northern-Ireland-Day-Trip-from-Dublin-Belfast-Black-Taxi-Tour-and-Giants-Causeway/d503-5300BLACKCAB">Guided Tour</a> that took us from Dublin to Belfast, <a href="https://discovernorthernireland.com/things-to-do/dunluce-castle-p675011">Dunce Castle</a>, and to the <a href="https://giantscausewayofficialguide.com">Giants Causeway</a>. This tour was spectacular. First we did the Black Cab Tour which was perhaps the most informative thing I have done thus far. We learned of the politics of Northern Ireland, which are not made for the people. There are the Irish Nationalists, those who wish for a united Ireland, and the Unionists, those who support the UK rule within Ireland. These groups of people ate segregated by a wall, and the murals that exist on each side are opposites. On the Irish side, there are murals of the hunger strike, Nelson Mandela and civil rights activists, and support for Palestine. Crossing the wall, there is harsh propaganda messaging and extreme support for Israel. It was extremely difficult to see this difference, and it puts into perspective how severe this issue is. One thing that our tour guide said that really stuck with me was this: “The UK would have bombed us by now, but they can&apos;t because we share the same skin color.” These politics will be something that I continue to watch and support until there is a whole Ireland. </p>
            <p>After the tour, we went to the Dunluce Castle. This was beautiful. It was a perfect day to visit, and the scenery was sublime. There were many places to explore and the ruins were intricate and interesting. After our tour here, we went off to the Giant&apos;s Causeway, which may be one of the coolest things I have ever seen. We took a cliff walk hike down to the shore and the views were simply spectacular. We learned all about the geological history as well as the mythological, both giving great reasoning to this unique formation. Each rock is a polygon, and it was like a set os stepping stones throughout. There were waves crashing on the shore, and little pools of water with lower sets of rocks. It is truly something I think everyone should see, and I could not recommend it more. We took a bus home and I got some good rest for the remainder of the night. </p>

        <h3>The NDA and The Lord Edward</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-13">May 13, 2024</time>
        <p>May 13: After class we visited the <a href="https://nda.ie/">National Disability Authority of Ireland (NDA)</a> where we learned lots about how the EU has created legislation to increase web accessibility and how accessible design should not be an afterthought but bart of the design process. It was a very interesting lecture, especially learning about the differences in how the US approaches accessibility vs how the EU does. Accessibly is something I am very passionate about, and is something I will be focusing on within my future UX endeavors. </p>
        <p>After the talk, I went to StayCity for a bit to do some dinner research. I ended up getting dinner at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fullmoonthaidublin/?hl=en">Full Moon</a>. I got Pad Thai and it was quite good (although quite expensive). I went there on my own and got to spend some time reading and relaxing a bit. I do love to go out on my own at times, as being around so many people is fulfilling, but exhausting at times. Later, A few classmates and I went to <a href="https://www.thedublinpublopedia.com/blog/thelordedward">The Lord Edward</a> to get a Guinness as our tour guide said it was the best one in town. It was quite delicious, and the pour was so pretty I didn&apos;t even want to drink it. Outside of us, there were only two other women in the bar, which was a bit odd but not scary like it would have been in the US. Overall, we had a great night and went back home for some rest.</p>

        <h3>A Day Alone in Dublin</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-14">May 14, 2024</time>
        <p>Today I traveled around the city on my own. I have been meaning to walk around and see all that Dublin has to offer, and it did not dissapoint. I first went to the <a href="https://www.museum.ie/">National History Museum - Archeology</a>. It was a cool place, but because I am not too interested in archeology, it did not captivate me as much as I wish it did. After the visit I got a delicious sandwich at Honey Truffle, which was packed with people on lunch break. I shopped around a few gift shops including a very cute plant store, and then explored the docklands. There was a surf shop that I wanted to visit out there, but when I arrived it was different than I was hoping. It is definitely a store more meant for e-commerce and lessons, as they did not have much of a retail space. </p>
        <p>After my visits, I took the bus back to the IMMA. They had one exhibit  open which was very interesting. It was about <a href="https://imma.ie/whats-on/we-realised-the-power-of-it-derry-film-video-workshop/">Derry Film and Video Workshop</a>. That was the only exhibit open, so I walked a round for quite a while. Later that night a few classmates and I went to BigFan for some absolutely delicious tapas and later went to <a href="https://www.noname.bar/">The Bar With No Name</a> for some cocktails and a seat on the patio. It was an adorable place that was nice and hidden away. Quite overpriced, but enjoyable nonetheless.</p>

        <h3>Microsoft!</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-15">May 15, 2024</time>
        <p>After class, I got a great veggie sandwich from the <a href="https://thefumbally.ie">Fumbally</a> and went home to change for our visit to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/aboutireland">Microsoft</a>. I took the tram there nice and early just in case, so I had some extra time to sit in the warm sun. Eventually we all made it to the tour. The tour was interesting and it was nice to see what such a large corporate space looks like. I am still unsure if a place like that would suit me, but it is interesting none the less.</p>
        <p>On our way back to StayCity, the tram lost all power and was shut down. This was right during rush hour traffic so we were all feeling a bit stressed. We got a taxi home after waiting for one for almost 30 minutes and we all got some food at <a href="https://johnsbar.ie"> John’s Bar and Haberdashery</a>. By this point, we were all hangry so we all got the student meal deal. I got the veggie burger with garlic fries which was so so good. We all took a bit of a rest and then went back to Street 66. It was game night there, so we all played some cards. This got competitive really quick, and Sam ended the game as our loser. </p>
