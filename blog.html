            <h3>Exploring Dublin: A City of History and Culture</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-07">May 7, 2024</time>
            <p>On Tuesday, we traveled around the city on a bus tour. This was extremely informative although quite bloody. It was quite interesting to hear about the long history of the state, as it is a stark difference of the few hundred years of the colonized US. We visited many different areas like the <a href="https://www.museum.ie/en-IE/Museums/Natural-History">National History Museum</a>, <a href="https://www.dublincastle.ie">Dublin Castle</a>, and <a href="https://www.phoenixpark.ie">Phoenix Park</a>. Each place had its own unique history and culture, and it is clear to see how important these places are to Irish culture. We learned about the resilience of the Irish population and the great diaspora of the Irish people due to fleeing from the country. <br><br>
                Arriving back to the apartment after the tour, I was pretty beat. I ended up going to the local grocery store to grab a few things for dinner, and I ended up making myself a nice meal. The kitchen is quite small, but I was able to manage. Later that night, I met up with a few classmates and we went to <a href="https://darkeykellys.ie">Darkey Kelley&apos;s</a>. A family friend told me about the place, so I was excited to visit. They had some great live music going and everyone there was quite sweet. We stayed for some tunes and then head out for home. <br><br>

            <h3>Visiting Vice Coffee</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-08">May 8, 2024</time>
            <p>After Class on Wednesday I went with Anastacia and Navya to a great hardware store and lunch. We needed charging adapters as our UK ones did not work. We also went to <a href="https://www.xianstreetfooddublin.ie">Xian Street Food</a> and finally got a spice bowl. Apparently it is an Irish Chinese creation, and it was quite delicious. I mean, you cannot go wrong with a bowl of spiced fried food. After lunch, I peeled off to visit a coffee shop I researched before coming, <a href="https://www.vicecoffeeinc.com">Vice Coffee</a>. When I arrived, it was not what I was expecting! By day, it is a regular cafe, but by night it also becomes a cocktail bar. The decor was adorable, and it is a very queer place. The coffee was spectacular (I got an americano with beans roasted in the UK) and I was able to get a few emails written regarding my summer jobs. <br><br>

            After my adventures, I went back to StayCity to do some laundry and later got dinner with some of the class. I was planning on meeting some other classmates at St. Stephen&apos;s Green, but they were leaving just as I had arrived. We were able to make plans for dinner though. We went to <a href="https://johnsbar.ie"> John&apos;s Bar and Haberdashery</a> to get a student meal deal, and the burgers were absolutely delicious! There was a great atmosphere and we all had a blast. We all then went out to <a href="https://www.jackies.ie">Jackie&apos;s</a>, a funky cocktail bar. We all got to know each other a bit more, and got home early enough to have a good rest before class. <br><br>

            <h3>Lectures, Food, and Fun!</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-09">May 9, 2024</time>
            <p>On the way to class in the morning, I walked alone and listened to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3440hCSfwYXxJcbQ0j3jAJ">&apos;The Age of Pleasure&apos; by Janelle Monet</a>. I have been trying to find the best albums that give the right “vibe” for being in Dublin, and that one was quite great. It is upbeat matching the nice day funky enough to match the culture. I am really enjoying class, and am excited to keep building this site, as I am rather proud of how it has been turning out. We all walked back to the apartment and I stopped by the <a href="https://thefumbally.ie">Fumbally</a> for a piece of Focaccia bread to make a sandwich at home. We all took some time to ourselves and got ready for our guest lecture.<br><br>

            The guest lecture was extremely interesting! We learned about Gamification and its implementation into technology. It made me interested in the idea of working within gaming, as UX is such a powerful tool that can be used anywhere. After the lecture, most of the class went off to explore. We searched for a dinner spot, and ended up going to a place called <a href="https://theramenbar.ie">The Ramen Bar</a>. It was extremely tasty, and we had the whole basement to ourselves! That night, I spent some time with Navya and my roomie Annabel. We went to Street 66, which was so bright and welcoming. Definitely a place to visit again before we leave.<br><br>
